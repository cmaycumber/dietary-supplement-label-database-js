# dietary-supplement-label-database-client

Unofficial javascript client for the Dietary Supplement Label Database created by Food and Drug Administration

## Why create this?

This js library was created for the purpose of filling the need for a better API for the Dietary Supplement Database. Although the database currently has an API it is very limited and doesn't support a client side library.

This library wraps the API that is used to create the tables on <https://dsld.od.nih.gov/dsld/index.jsp> so that developers can have an easier time accessing the data on the Dietary Supplement Label Database.

## Future support

The maintainers of the Dietary Supplement Label Database have stated they are working on building a more robust API that will allow developers to more easily interact with the Dietary Supplement Label Database.

Until then this API will try to fill the gap. When the maintainers of the Dietary Supplement Label Database release there more robust API this library will shit focus to wrapping the improved API unless an official js client library is supported.
